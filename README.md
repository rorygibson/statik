# CES - Content Editing System

A very simple content editing system.

The premise is that if you've got a proper designer building your website, they want to work in plain ol' HTML, CSS and maybe JS.
And they're going to give you a zip file of stuff.
If you want to be able to change the words (not the images, or the layout, or the colours - *designers hate that*) then you can't, unless you know a bit about HTML.

The idea of CES is, as a designer who can work an FTP client, it should be possible to throw the static resources into a directory on a server, and it just becomes editable when you're signed in.

You give the client some login details and that's it, they've got a minimal, editable website.

Just like that.

(It's not there yet, but we're well on the way).

## Prerequisites

Requires (currently), on the server:
 - Java 7
 - Maven 3 (to build, a packaged binary will be forthcoming soon)
 - MongoDB

Requires (as a designer who wants to give a client an editable website):
 - a website, expressed as a set of static .html files, CSS, JavaScript, images etc.

## Setup
    git clone https://github.com/rorygibson/ces.git

    mkdir /home/rory/websites/my-site (or wherever)

    dump the HTML of your static site into the directory

    configure the src/main/resources/config.properties with your MongoDB details, path to website and the name and password of the author account you want to give to your client

    mvn clean package tomcat:run-war

    open browser on http://[host]:8080/index.html


##Â TODO

 - Binary packaging and release, with externalised config
 - Productionise - no tests right now
 - Editing of repeated elements (nth in a list, or second of 4 paragraphs) will result in the results appearing the the wrong element - it's not taking account of nth-child selectors in the JS.
 - Needs to have a JS editor - just using contenteditable looks rough. Something like wysihtml or maybe Aloha (bit heavy though)
 - Editability of an element should be signified by the author, by right clicking on elements of allowed types (headings, LIs, spans, paras, sections... - only those containing text?), probably with a right click menu
 - / and index.html (welcome file) are treated as separate pages so don't share content
